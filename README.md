On this webpage, users enter the type of food and its location. Based on the input, the web page lists and presents the results to the user. The web page consists of multiple pages. There is a home page, a page showing the search results, a page with details of the places listed, and a page with information about the brand. In general, my project lists the nearest restaurants according to users' preferences. For each restaurant, it shows information such as menu, price, reviews and ratings. It allows users to see the restaurants on the map. If the user registers and logs in to my page, comments can be made under the restaurants. The web page will provide users with a pleasant experience with MERN's dynamic structure. With this web page, users will be able to easily access the flavors they are looking for, make comments and ratings, see the address, phone number, menu of the restaurant, see the location of the restaurant on the map and go to that location.
