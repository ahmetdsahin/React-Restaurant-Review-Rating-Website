#Restaurant Review and Rating Website

On this web page, users input food type and location. Based on the input, the web page lists the results and presents them to the user.
The web page consists of multiple pages. There is a home page, a page showing the search results, a page with the details of the places listed and a page with information about the brand. The front part of the web page was created with ReactJS and TailwindCSS and the back part was created with NodeJS, MongoDB. My project generally lists the closest restaurants according to users' preferences. For each restaurant, it shows information such as menu, price, reviews and score. It allows users to see the restaurants on the map. If the user registers and logs in to my page, comments can be made under the restaurants.
The web page will give users a pleasant experience with MERN's dynamic structure. With this web page, users will be able to easily access the flavors they are looking for, comment and rate them, see the address, phone number, menu of the restaurant, see the location of the restaurant on the map and go to that location.
